AMI Subsystem
===============

Current State of affairs:

1. We connect to Asterisk AMI, grab the banner, authenticate and
   start ami_recv:loop() which is the receiving processor for
   messages coming in from the open'd Socket.
2. We spawn off and register the process in Step 1 above from the 
   function ami:new/[4,2].
3. ami:new/[4,2] is also responsible for starting the ami_msg process.
   This is the process that recieves commands from users and sends via
   the Socket to AMI and also, recieves FULLY ASSEMBLED messages from
   the ami_recv:loop/1 process.

This is the very basics of the whole infrastructure. More details to come
in soon.
