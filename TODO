- amilist_to_block/4 and lineslist_to_amilist should be mirror images
  as much as possible. Now lineslist_to_amilist is too complex with 
  a lot of violations of the SPOT rule. also the logic can
  be confusing. Consider writing a function to detect if a line starts
  with a single word followed by a colon, and use that for filtering the
  payload out
- BUG in parsing, when we recieve a Key: without a value, we kick into
  payload mode. fix this. (where the heck is yeck :P)
- Try to encapsulate all uses of ets, so we can hide it properly and 
  potentialy swap it out. See all the state machines (amiclient_interp, etc).

  And not just ets, but lots of other low-level modules

- The model for client event hangling now, is kind of a round 
  about method to direct event routing. What I want to see is:

    EvtHandler = funkyapp:event_handler_new(),
    ami:event_handler_set(Ami, 'Newstate', EvtHandler).

    Inside EvtHandler, I want to see this:

    receive
        {Interp, [{event, 'Newstate'} | _Rest} ->
            do somestuff;
        {Interp, [{event, 'Hangup'} | _Rest]} ->
            do some other stuff;
    end.
