- Re organize entire project source files
- Consider dumping the Dict() and using TupleLists with
  keyX functions from lists module
- Implement Event processor, first for Channel handling for Originate
- amilist:from_block and amilist:to_block are not perfectly symmetrical
  Currently, to_block does not handle the EXTRA PAYLOAD that normally goes
  with Response: Follows and ends with --END COMMAND--. This has to be
  a mirror of the process in from_block.
