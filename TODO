- Implement Event processor, first for Channel handling for Originate
- amilist_to_block/4 and lineslist_to_amilist should be mirror images
  as much as possible. Now lineslist_to_amilist is too complex with 
  a lot of violations of the SPOT rule. also the logic can
  be confusing. Consider writing a function to detect if a line starts
  with a single word followed by a colon, and use that for filtering the
  payload out
- BUG in parsing, when we recieve a Key: without a value, we kick into
  payload mode. fix this. (where the heck is yeck :P)
