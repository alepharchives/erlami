- Consider dumping the Dict() and using TupleLists with
  keyX functions from lists module
- Implement Event processor, first for Channel handling for Originate
- amilist_to_block/4 and lineslist_to_amilist should be mirror images
  as much as possible. Now lineslist_to_amilist is too complex with 
  a lot of violations of the SPOT rule. also the logic can
  be confusing. Consider writing a function to detect if a line starts
  with a single word followed by a colon, and use that for filtering the
  payload out
- also, consider making the session/interpreter into a standalone framework that
  can be potentially reused in the client. (Started refactoring this part)
